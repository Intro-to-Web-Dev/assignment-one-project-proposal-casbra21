        <p>
            I would like to model my website off of Nua Bikes. I like the simplicity and very easy to navigate format. 
            The minimal colors help keep the focus on the products. I also like that it feels intuitive and is direct on where to find the products.

             <li>To showcase local minneapolis artists.</li>
             <li>Use a clean, simple, and easy to navigte design.</li>
             <li>Have a way for the user to find artists social media and contact information </li>

         </ol>
        <p>
            I will have at least 4 individual webpages. I will have a home page, an artist page, a contact page, and an about page. 
            These pages will allow the user to get to know what the purpose of the website is, learn about local arists, and reach out with questions or 
            how to get involved in the arts community.
        </p>
         <p>The target audience is people interested in art and the arts community. They may be an artist themselves, collectors, buyers, etc.
             Some reasons they might visit this site is to learn about local artists, learn about upcoming art events, and to find other resources
             regarding the Minneapolis art scene.
